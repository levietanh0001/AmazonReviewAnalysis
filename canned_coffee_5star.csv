5,One bottle broken but good coffee,"Love the coffee , but one bottle broken when I opened the box"
5,My fave Starbucks beverage delivered to my door,"Love the flavor, the size, and convenience of having it delivered to my door as a Prime customer. The grocery store I frequent only sells the smaller size, and only in 4 pack - and ridiculously priced unless BOGO. Thank you Amazon/Subscribe & Save for re-adding this product to the S&S choices."
5,We like the bigger containers,It’s ok
5,Luv it!,Caramel is my favorite. A few weeks I couldn’t find these at any of the stores. So glad I was able to find them on here.
5,Always great - too expensive,"Like always, Starbucks is great, but too expensive. I hear that all the time & I feel the same way. Can’t afford it all the time."
5,Good Morning!,Rich & Refreshing Beverage!
5,Frappucino,"Hubbys addiction to this crap was satisfied when our local storrs ran out! Keeps him happy, that's all that matters"
5,Wife loves it,Nothing more to say as wife loves it
5,great taste,Available at a good price
5,A bit deceitful.,"I feel that it is a bit deceitful to put another item there when the one a person wants isn't available. Yes, I will pay close attention to my orders from now on."
5,BEST,BEST
5,Love this stuff!,Mocha is by far my favorite..smooth coffee chocolate flavor! Little spendy but is sooo good!
5,Retailers don't stock it around here any more.,It's the best cold coffee I have found. Hard to find locally.
5,My favorite drink,"I have enjoyed Starbucks Frappuccino Mocha for some now. I have always felt they were a little overpriced. I wish I could find their ""Lite"" version of this flavor. There are less expensive brands around, but none of them are as delicious as the Starbucks version in my opinion."
5,1 bottle in the box was broken,1 bottle in the box was broken
5,Best Flavor!,Very thankful to be able to order my favorite flavor. Delivered direct to my door.
5,The best mocha coffee,"I cannot resist this coffee, iced, in the summertime. It's so delicious and refreshing. What will I do in the winter?"
5,Very timely delivery,"We've started drinking more of these, but local food stores were very erratic in stocking them.
Buying by the case solves this well!"
5,The pkg not marked breakable & 2 were empty & broken,1st that I ordered box was marked breakable & heavy - but this time only marked heavy & 2 bottles were broken & emptied all over box!
5,Great product,Great flavor at a great price

5,Convenience,I drink this daily
5,Great Source,I have never had a problem ordering here. I stopped trying to find it in stores. Fresh tasting and quick delivery.
5,Good stuff,Great product!
5,No safety seals,"There are no safety seals on any of the frapps, I wonder why not. Does any one else have this problem. The pop up on the lid is still in tac tho. I love this mocha flavor, but I have noticed at times it doesn't taste as creamy."
5,Addicted,"I'm addicted to the Mocha Frappes!!😍 I order everytime they're available!!💜 My only complaint is, if I buy them at the store. EBT will cover them!! But to save money and order from Amazon. EBT won't cover them!! 😢 And that's not right!! 🤔 Just because I have to depend on Food Stamps, doesn't mean it shouldn't be covered!!😢😢😢"
5,Can it get any better?,Loved getting my favorite coffee delivered right to my door!

5,I love the taste of this drink😀,I love the flavor of this drink and it’s a great buy😀
5,Not best item to have shipped,The product is my favorite. I ordered this product twice. Both shipments were damaged in transit resulting in having about 9 useable out of 36 ordered. I will just continue to purchase my Starbucks locally. Expensive lesson.
5,Yummy!!!,Arrived on time!
5,Delicious Mocha Frap,Classic delight
5,Cost the same as Walmart per bottle,Best flavor between Mocha and Vanilla extremely hard to find at this price
5,Delicious,Awesome
5,My wife’s favorite drink,This flavor is hard to find at a reasonable price but Amazon had it so we bought the twelve pack. It’s mostly Gond so we just reordered another 12 bottles. They really pack them we so all 24 bottles arrived unbroken.
5,I would not buy this flavor. It was ordered by mistak,I do not like the flavor.
5,Finally not price gouging!,Love this flavor! This seller didn’t price gouge!!
5,A Great Find,It has all the flavor that my wife as looking for in a cold coffee.
5,Very Good....,"1 Broken Bottle Out Of 24, I Can Live With That. Very Good Price.."
5,Value,Best price yet I've come across on the internet for the size
5,amazing,i want to drink 6 of these every day
5,FAST shipping!,"Love this coffee! Not a lot of caffeine, which is good for me since I don’t tolerate it well. Price is same as in the stores. This seller ships really fast! I’ve ordered from them again and again it shipped out next business day!"
5,PERFECT !!!!!!!,Everything was Perfect . Thank's !!!
5,Good product bad vendor,Just make sure that it’s not coming from natures they arrive broken and moldy a month later
5,Great drink,Good quantity and flavor
5,"Packaging change, plastic tampering seal not missing.","Someone mentioned that the wrap that went up the side of the bottle and over the cap was missing. That was all one piece of the bottle label, and now that label has been redesigned to only extend to the bottom of the cap. This is my go to drink, addicted doesn’t describe me accurately enough. I enjoy the coffee flavor, I find it less sweet than the others, but still sweet and creamy. Given everything in 2020 this has been harder to find. Only had one issue with a broken bottle but Amazon allows a return based on this."
5,Fast Delivery,Awesome delivery! Love it!
5,Awesome,Great taste my husband love it
5,Just Right,Her mother loves it and drinks it every day. A great source of taste and enjoyment.
5,My favorite,I started getting these cases because of local shortages . Finding a coffee flavored Frappuccino in my area was almost impossible so I subscribed to a case every couple weeks! Perfect! AND for the same price as buying them at Sheetz !
5,Love This Drink,I enjoy one each and every day. I guess I am addicted. The caramel is better than the regular or lite Mocha.
5,Thank you! Very convenient,I Only like the mocha ones .
5,Double Serving,Nothing better than Starbucks flavor in large bottles!
5,Great choice.,Excellent
5,One WORD YUM!,"I love, love, love this product. I order it regularly. Pricy, but delish."
5,Delicious 🤤,Yum
5,Great value,Flavors
5,Breakfast every day,Expensive but I’m addicted.
5,Great deal,Well when my local store didn't have it... Y'all came thru So happy and the right price
5,Easy to order,My favorite flavor
5,Love these-good price,Love these drinks. I had to cancel my subscription though because my delivery kept getting delayed. Good price for the size.
5,Why is it not be delivered anymore from you?,I love this product could get two 4 62$ since u don’t deliver it any any longer will cost over $113…crazy🥵
5,My addiction delivered to my door,"I have a serious addiction to the Mocha Frapps. I work from home and drink a few of these a day. I have a hard time finding enough locally to supply my addiction and was delighted to find my preferred size for delivery. I order 3-4 cases every 2 weeks and have only had 1 bottle that was broken because everything is well packed. I came back to order today and it appears that they aren’t available. Please, for my mental health bring back mocha frapps."
5,Love Starbucks,I love Starbucks!!!!
5,I love these drinks,To drink in stead of coffee
5,It’s good!,I love the fact I can get it! My grocery store doesn’t carry coffee flavor. The coffee is always well packed and has never arrived with a crack or break. This is my favorite flavor.
5,Larger bottle step up from one use to.,If I order again I would order the smaller bottle. Sugar Sugar!
5,Starbucks ain’t cheap,Not cheap but much better than retail stores.
5,Delicious,I love this stuff.. it's the only bottled coffee thing that I drink . getting difficult to find in stores where I live so ordering it by the case here is a really good alternative . and it costs about the same especially with free shipping
5,Mornin java!,"Taste great, good value."
5,Vanilla frappuccino,Absolutely love this coffee why did I pay 31 dollars Last time and now it's 51 dollars that's a big jump there sometime 2 for 5 in the store can you tell why it's so expensive now???
5,Its contains lots of Calories,1 bottle is enough for two to share- -Tasty but sweet- A little pricy- Folks on weight watch or sugar careful- need to read ingredient's- Great for a summer treat-
5,Lovely coffee surprise. Almost dessert.,"I love the coffee flavor. It’s less sweet that vanilla or carmel and I’m not a fan of mocha—it’s indecisive, is it coffee or chocolate. But the coffee flat is more robust, less sweet, and more defined. Very satisfying."
5,Wonderful!!!,I wish you sell and deliver almond milk flavors
5,Vanila Frappucciono,"Great Flavor, price, and got in in good time."
5,Starbucks coffee was great but they do not value their customers,Starbucks Vanilla Frappe in the bottle have been my morning coffee for many years. I do not understand WHY Starbucks jerks their customers around. They claimed White Choc Moch wasn't selling either when they discontinued it but I am a cashier and can assure it most certainly was. Now we can't get the Vanilla Frapps in.
5,Great RTF Starbucks vanilla frappe!,They packed the bottles in a sturdy box. They arrived early. They were very refreshing.
5,Well packaged,Great product
5,Coffee flavor is the best..😊,"We love the coffee flavor, can't find in grocery store. The flavor is wonderful, a bit pricey, the caffeine kick is very good, love it.🌹"
5,good stuff.,love it.
5,Delicious !,Taste great
5,Great for the price.,Of course addicted to this product. Not a bad price fro being shipped to your home. Packed well I have ordered several times and not one broken bottle.
5,It tastes great,Love the flavor but alittle pricey
5,Starbucks Frap is the best,This has been one of my favorites for a long time and will always have it in the frig. I serve it to my f riends also.
5,Taste great and look forward to my next order,These are the best I go all over town to get these even tho they are a little more it's ok they bring them to my door and they are not broke and I WILL BE ORDERING MORE I Do hope in the future we will get the small size also just to take to beach. Thanks so much for being convient you always come thru for me
5,Exceptional drink,Great as a impromptu cold brew drink. Tired of same old drink. This adds pizzazz to your busy day.
5,Mother loves,My 97 yr old mother loves it!!!!
5,Good way to buy,Good stuff shipped fast great price
5,Too pricey,"Purchase for my friend who is in the VA Resdential center( lives there).
He enjoys these but they cost too much.
I mean you get like 12 bottles for about 50 bucks.
Will not be purchasing these again."
5,Great value,Love love love these drinks they are my weakness everyday flavor is great and so is the price please keep selling them
5,"No broken bottles, packaged very well","My drinks came in earlier than expected, which made me very happy. They came in packaged very well and there were no broken bottles. Most of my local stores are out of these drinks so buying them like this is actually cheaper and now I don't have to run all over town looking for my favorite drink."
5,It's Starbucks,Taste great. Good value for what you get.
5,Hard to find,"This is my most favorite drink in the world trouble is, the stores are always out of
Stock!"
5,My concern was shipping - but it's fine.,"My husband and I got into the habit of having frappuccinos on the weekends, and when our local grocery store seemed to be having trouble getting our preferred mocha flavor, of course we turned to Amazon. I was concerned about the shipping, but it's incredibly secure, really strong cardboard, and it arrives quickly. So come the weekend, we'll be having our frappuccinos, no worries about running out or the store not having them. Yay."
5,I am addicted to Mocha Frappuccino!,"I drink at least 2 bottles a day - it is smooth, chocolaty, satisfying on so many levels! I shouldn't give it a good review because there have been too many times recently that it has been out of stock, but I love it too much to demean it.
Some addicts can't live without their booze or drugs, I can't live without my Frap!"
5,Yum! Yummy!!,Yummy!!!
5,"High caffeine, don't drink at night","Really liked this until I read the amount of caffeine in it, almost as much as a red bull"
5,Great,None broken and what I was looking for
5,Arrived safely,Glass bottles arrived unbroken and safe. Ready to go into the fridge!
5,Fantastic packaging!!,We ran out of coffee drinks in our area so figured I would try this out. My boyfriend was actually so impressed by how these came packaged that he asked for the link and is now subscribing to order 2 of these cases every 2 weeks. Thank you very much!!!!
5,Good Price,This is my favorite flavor. It’s hard to find it in grocery stores now
5,Love them.,"I am a fan of these, so nothing to add."
5,Best,The best
5,Delicious,Love this flavor and this tall size is the best.
5,Love my morning Starbucks!,Quick delivery. Package for shipment properly. Great product. Long expiration date on bottle.
5,Great flavor. Great service.,"This is my favorite Starbucks product of all time. Arrived safe in a sturdy, reliable packaging."
5,Cheaper than my local grocery store outstanding!,You can't beat Starbucks in person but where I'm living we don't have a Starbucks... It's an hour drive! The local grocery stores know it so they charge 2.85 a bottle. I was so happy to find Amazon not only sells them but cheaper than my local grocery store.
5,It’s going to be a GOOD MORNING 🌞,The best breakfast in the morning 👍🍶stores that carry this flavor have been hit and miss so this was an awesome way to stock up!
5,Oh yum ! My favorite brew,Great tasting and hard to find flavor of Starbucks Frappuccino !
5,Fast and great packaging,Box arrived a little dented but their packing is genius. The glass bottles were totally unharmed.
5,This is the best coffee in the morning,Keep ordering it good taste
5,Love it!,I love how nice they came in nothing was broken and everything was sorted very neatly!
5,Cheaper than buying at the store.,I'm absolutely addicted to these drinks and I have a hard time finding them so I decided to look online and sure enough...just like anything else I could possibly think of...found it on Amazon! If you do the math it's about a dollar cheaper per bottle than buying them at the store. I've ordered several cases now and every time they have arrived on time with not a single bottle broken. No complaints here..
5,starbucks frappucino coffee flavor,why is starbucks discontinuing coffee flavor?
5,cofee,I love the taste of this coffee and the ease of getting it
5,The best love em,Great cold coffee
5,"About the same price as locally without having to go out to get it, locally $2.50 each plus tax.","I really like the mocha flavor, and these prices are only $0.13 more than I would pay locally. Everything arrived intact, very well packaged."
5,Great Price Deal for a delicious Coffee Drink,"Starbucks Vanilla Frappuccino are the most popular flavor starbucks offers. Their a good drink chilled or room temperature. Its more milk than coffee, but black coffee effected my stomach. So switching to these and no issues was extremely welcoming. is a great deal for twelve of the 13.7 oz bottles. I pay $2.99 to $3.59 each in town where I live."
5,Summer in a bottle,I love this I always keep it on hand
5,No time for lines.,"I love Starbucks frappuccino but I don't always have time to wait in line, I make my own ice shake and go."
5,Another flawless delivery,"I am not doubting other users complaints of damaged boxes and broken bottles, just want to say I have ordered this Starbucks liquid coffee 6-7 times now, along with other bottled drinks over time, and have never had one broken bottle yet! Starbucks chilled coffee is great for a quick pick me up in the afternoon.."
